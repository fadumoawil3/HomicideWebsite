                  <dd> Homicide is the act of one person intentionally causing the death of another. It can occur in a variety of ways, including murder, manslaughter, and justifiable homicide (such as self-defense).
                      The key factor that defines homicide is that it involves the killing of one individual by another, whether intentionally or through recklessness or negligence.

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>If you witness a homicide or a violent crime, your immediate priority should be your safety. If possible, remove yourself from the area and contact emergency services immediately. Avoid touching anything at the scene as it could be critical evidence.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>It's important to watch for warning signs such as threats, history of violent behavior, obsession with a person or event, and access to weapons. If you suspect someone may be dangerous, take precautions, report your concerns to authorities, and avoid contact if possible.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Self-defense is a legal justification for using force, including deadly force, to protect oneself from immediate harm. If a homicide is deemed to be in self-defense, it may not result in criminal charges. However, the specific circumstances are always evaluated by the authorities and the justice system.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Communities affected by frequent homicides may experience a breakdown in social cohesion, increased fear, and distrust. This can lead to a decrease in economic activity, mental health issues, and even normalization of violence. These effects can persist for generations.</p>

                <button class="faq-question">5. How does the law distinguish between murder and manslaughter?</button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Murder is typically defined as the unlawful killing of a person with intent or malice. Manslaughter, on the other hand, occurs when a person kills another without premeditation or intent, often in a heat of passion or due to recklessness, without the intent to cause death.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Supporting someone who has been affected by homicide involves providing emotional support, being a good listener, and helping them find professional counseling if needed.
